         <h2 class="title">Sinharaja Forest</h2>
         <p class="description">Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a 11250 hectare national park located in the southwestern part of the Rakwana Range in the central highlands of Sri Lanka at an altitude of 300-1170 meters and it borders Galle district. It has received international attention and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Part of Sri Lanka's Lowland Rainforest Ecoregion, this virgin montane rainforest has been protected from commercialization due to access difficulties. The fact that this was named as a biosphere reserve in 1607 and as a world heritage site in 1988 was another reason for that. The name of the reserve 'Sinharajaya' means 'Sinharajadahana'. The distance from east to west of the reserve is km. 81 and the maximum distance from North to South is KM. Although 7, it is a safe sanctuary for plant species as well as endemic species including insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. Due to the dense vegetation, wild animals are not easily seen here like in dry zone parks like Yala. Here you can see the last three elephants of the wet zone and leopards are rarely seen. Recently a rare black leopard (tiger) died and the largest mammal that can be seen is the Sri Lankan gray monkey. One inspiring phenomenon is the tendency of birds to behave in collective flocks, often in search of food. Such a flock often consists of the great cauda and the red tamilcha. The Maha Kauda, which takes the lead in such a flock, is known as a violent bird and the Red Tamiliccha is known as a noisy bird. Various birds can be seen here.</p>
